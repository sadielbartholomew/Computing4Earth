# Earth system modelling

* Modelling and simulation
* Model types
  * GCM vs. ESM
* Components and example common models
  * Atmosphere
  * Ocean
  * Land Surface
  * Cryosphere - land ice (glaciers, ice sheets) and sea ice.
  * Biosphere: terrestrial and marine
  * Biogeochemical Cycles: e.g. carbon cycle,nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus cycles
  * Anthroposphere (i.e. human systems)
* Coupling components
* Coupled models
* Data Assimilation
* Ensembles
* Global vs. regional climate models
* Model intercomparison (projects)
