# Earth system modelling

* Modelling and simulation
* Model types
  * GCM vs. ESM
* Components and example models
  * atmosphere
  * ocean
  * land surface
  * cryosphere - land ice (glaciers, ice sheets) and sea ice.
  * biosphere: terrestrial and marine
  * biogeochemical cycles: e.g. carbon cycle,nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus cycles
  * anthroposphere (i.e. human systems)
* Coupling components
  * Coupled models
* Data Assimilation
* Ensembles
* Global vs. regional climate models
* Model intercomparison (projects)
