# Basics of Earth System Science

* Weather vs. climate
  * NWP
    * forecasting, hindcasting, nowcasting
  * climatology
* Science of specific Earth system components
  * atmosphere
    * circulation
    * water cycle: clouds and precipitation
    * radiation
  *  oceanography
    * currents
    * thermohaline circulation
    * heat transport
  * cryosphere
    * glaciers
    * ice sheets
    * sea ice
    * permafrost
* Interations between components 
* Climate dynamics and processes
  * energy balance & radiative forcing – greenhouse effect, aerosols, albedo
  * cycles
    * biogeochemical
      * carbon cycle
  * feedback mechanisms
  * natural climate variability
    * ENSO (El Niño-Southern Oscillation)
      * El Niño, La Niña
      * Southern Oscillation
    * Pacific Decadal Oscillation
    * volcanic eruptions
    * solar cycles
  * carbon Cycle and biogeochemical Cycles – carbon sources/sinks, nitrogen cycle, feedbacks
* Past, present and future climate
  * past
    * paleoclimate
  * present
    * climate change
      * observed evidence and trends
        * human causes
      * impacts
        * extreme events: heatwaves, hurricanes, wildfires, compound events, droughts, floods
        * human impact: agriculture, health, urban climate, migration, freshwater availability
        * ecosystem responses: biodiversity shifts, ocean acidification, terrestrial ecosystems
      * proposed solutions
        * mitigation: renewable energy, carbon capture, geoengineering
        * adaptation: infrastructure, ecosystem-based adaptation, risk management
        * international agreements: IPCC, UNFCCC, Paris Agreement
        * equity and justice: climate justice, vulnerable populations, global inequalities
  * future
   * future projections
